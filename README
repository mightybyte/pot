This project is a placeholder for the template project that will eventually be
created by "snap init".  I think it will be easier if this project is
developed standalone and then dropped into snap/project_template.

The goal of this project is to build a web interface to creating snap
applications that is dead simple for even novice users to use.  It's the
"gateway drug" to Haskell. :)
